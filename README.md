## Tech Stack

Our front-end is built with React and Bootstrap, closely following the design we created in Figma. We've implemented all possible front-end functionalities.

Our back-end is built with Node.js and Express.js. We use MongoDB for our database, which stores user information for validating sign-ups and sign-ins. We have also implemented a two-way verification and password recovery service.
